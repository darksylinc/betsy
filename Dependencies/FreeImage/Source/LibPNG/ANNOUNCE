Changes since the last public release (1.6.34):

  Restored 21 of the contrib/pngsuite/i*.png, which do not cause test

  Added calls to png_set_*() transforms commonly used by browsers to
    the fuzzer.
  Removed some unnecessary brackets in pngrtran.c
  Fixed miscellaneous typos (Patch by github user "luzpaz").
  Change "ASM C" to "C ASM" in CMakeLists.txt
  Fixed incorrect handling of bKGD chunk in sub-8-bit files (Cosmin)
  Added hardware optimization directories to zip and 7z distributions.
  Fixed incorrect bitmask for options.
  Fixed many spelling typos.
  Make png_get_iCCP consistent with man page (allow compression-type argument
    to be NULL, bug report by Lenard Szolnoki).
  Replaced the remaining uses of png_size_t with size_t (Cosmin)
  Fixed the calculation of row_factor in png_check_chunk_length
    (reported by Thuan Pham in SourceForge issue #278)
  Added missing parentheses to a macro definition
    (suggested by "irwir" in GitHub issue #216)
